# Implementation Notes and Deviations from the SAD

The SAD, Mini-Project Part-2 and the role-based task division ask for any difference between the
implementation and the submitted documents to be written down and explained at the final demo.
This file tracks those differences. Update it whenever the code and the SAD disagree.

## Delivered scope

The current implementation includes TLS transport, idle-session expiry, presence and rooms,
direct/room messaging, persistent history, administration, audit logging, and input validation.
The earlier Sprint 1 “planned for later” list is no longer applicable: these features are present
in the current code. See the [requirements traceability matrix](requirements-traceability.md) for
the SRS, SAD, implementation, and STP mapping.

### Differences from the SAD
| # | SAD says | Implementation | Why |
|---|---|---|---|
| D1 | Offline recipient: `ACK {status: STORED_NOT_DELIVERED}` | Messages are stored and the ACK includes recipient/room, timestamp, and a human-readable `reason` in addition to the status. | Gives the sender enough context to distinguish offline direct delivery from a room with no other online member. |
| D2 | Oversized frame: rejected before reading the body | Still rejected from the length prefix alone. Bodies up to 1 MB are then skipped (not buffered) so the client can carry on; larger ones get `INVALID_MESSAGE` and the connection is closed. | Without skipping or closing, the TCP stream would be out of sync after the rejection. |
| D3 | Data Repository: all writes through one writer thread | Chat messages go through a dedicated writer thread (#9). Account, session and room changes are written directly under the same lock, so there is still only one writer at a time. | Those changes must be finished before the reply is sent (for example, a new room must exist before `CREATED` is returned). |
| D4 | Module layout lists components only | Added `server/app.py` (wires the layers), `server/config.py` (settings), `server/protocol/dispatcher.py` (passes validated requests to services), `server/protocol/messages.py` (ACK/ERROR/EVENT builders and error codes). | Keeps each SAD component in its own module; no new responsibilities. |
| D5 | Client Network Handler packs/unpacks messages | The client reuses `server/protocol/framing.py` instead of a copy. | One implementation of the wire format for both sides. |
| D6 | Not specified | Usernames are unique ignoring case (`Alice` and `alice` are the same account); the stored spelling is shown. | Prevents look-alike accounts. |
| D7 | Not specified | One active login per account; a second login gets `FORBIDDEN`. | Direct messages are routed by username, so one connection per user keeps delivery unambiguous. |
| D8 | Not specified | Usernames: 3-32 of `A-Z a-z 0-9 _ . -`; passwords 8-128 characters at registration; room names 1-32 of letters, digits, spaces, `_ . -`. | The SRS asks for "valid account information" without defining it. |
| D9 | Error codes table | `REGISTER`/`LOGIN` while already logged in returns `FORBIDDEN`. | Uses an existing code; no new codes were added. |

## Sprint 2

### Differences from the SAD
| # | SAD says | Implementation | Why |
|---|---|---|---|
| D10 | RoomMember has a Status column | No Status column: a row means "is a member" and leaving deletes the row. | Membership has only two states, so a row's presence is enough. |
| D11 | Not specified | The `LOGIN` ACK also returns `online` (users online now) and `rooms` (every room with its member count and whether you are in it). | The client needs both to draw its sidebar; the SAD has no separate list request. |
| D12 | Room Status OPEN / RESTRICTED / REMOVED | RESTRICTED rooms are read-only and closed to new members for everyone except administrators. REMOVED rooms behave as if they do not exist. | The SAD names the states without defining them. |
| D13 | Not specified | A room creator becomes its first member. A server holds at most `max_rooms` rooms; the next `CREATE_ROOM` gets `FORBIDDEN`. Room names are unique ignoring case. | Matches the `max_rooms` setting and the username rule (D6). |
| D14 | HISTORY: `room or with, before_ts, limit` | As in the SAD. `limit` defaults to 50 (maximum 100), `before_ts` defaults to now, and the reply has `more: true` when older messages may exist. Room history needs current membership; a direct conversation can only be read by its two participants. | The SAD lists the fields but not the defaults or the permission rule. |
| D15 | Not specified how an account becomes an administrator | `python -m server.manage make-admin <username>`, run on the server machine. There is no network request that grants the role. | A client must never be able to make itself an administrator (CHAT-SR-003). |
| D16 | ADMIN: `action, target, args` | Actions: `activate`, `deactivate`, `restrict` (target is a username); `open_room`, `restrict_room`, `remove_room`, `rename_room` with `args.name` (target is a room). Reply `ACK DONE {action, target, ...}`. Admins cannot change their own account. Deactivated or restricted users who are online get `EVENT account {status}` and are disconnected. | The SAD lists the request fields but not the actions. |
| D17 | AuditLog insert-only | Enforced by database triggers that reject UPDATE and DELETE on AuditLog. Records are written by the background writer thread, like messages. Log files get a redaction filter for passwords and session tokens, and on Linux/macOS are created readable by the server account only (umask 077). Windows has no equivalent permission bits, so there the folder's own permissions apply. | Makes "insert-only" a database guarantee, not just a convention. This does not prevent an operating-system/database administrator from modifying the database file offline. |
| D18 | SAD describes certificate pinning | The client loads `certs/server.crt` as a TLS trust file and uses normal certificate-chain and server-name verification. It does not separately compare a configured certificate fingerprint. | A local self-signed certificate can serve as the trust anchor for development, but production certificate provisioning, rotation, and trust-file management must be handled deliberately. |
| D19 | SRS describes message persistence when enabled | Persistent storage is always enabled; there is no persistence feature flag. Chat message content is stored in SQLite without application-level encryption at rest. | Keeps the implemented history feature available without an additional mode, but does not provide end-to-end or at-rest message encryption. |

## Protocol summary (as implemented)
Every frame is a 4-byte big-endian length followed by a UTF-8 JSON object, at most `max_frame_bytes`.

Client requests: `{"type", "seq", "payload", "session"}`. `session` is required after login.

| Request | Payload | Success reply |
|---|---|---|
| `REGISTER` | `username`, `password` | `ACK REGISTERED` |
| `LOGIN` | `username`, `password` | `ACK LOGGED_IN {session, username, role, online, rooms}` |
| `MSG` | `to`, `text` | `ACK DELIVERED {to, ts}` or `ACK STORED_NOT_DELIVERED {to, ts, reason}` |
| `MSG` | `room`, `text` | `ACK DELIVERED {room, ts, delivered_to}` or `ACK STORED_NOT_DELIVERED {room, ts, reason}`; `FORBIDDEN` if not a member |
| `CREATE_ROOM` | `room` | `ACK CREATED {room, members}` |
| `JOIN` | `room` | `ACK JOINED {room, members}` |
| `LEAVE` | `room` | `ACK LEFT {room}` |
| `ADMIN` | `action`, `target`, optional `args` | `ACK DONE {action, target, status or name}`; `FORBIDDEN` for non-administrators |
| `HISTORY` | `room` or `with`, optional `before_ts`, `limit` | `ACK HISTORY {room or with, messages: [{id, from, to or room, text, ts}], more}` (oldest first) |
| `LOGOUT` | none | `ACK LOGGED_OUT`, then the server closes the connection |
| `PING` | none | `PONG` |

The recipient gets `EVENT {kind: "msg", data: {from, to, seq, text, ts}}`, or `{from, room, seq, text, ts}`
for a room message.

Other events:
- `presence {user, status: online|offline}` goes to everyone online.
- `room {action: created, room}` goes to everyone online.
- `join {room, user}` and `leave {room, user}` go to the room's other online members.
- `room {action: restricted|opened|removed, room}` and `room {action: renamed, room, name}` go to everyone online.
- `account {status, reason}` goes to a user an administrator has just deactivated or restricted, before they are disconnected.
Errors are `ERROR {ref_seq, code, reason}` with the codes from the SAD.

## Verification status and known limitations

- The latest full regression run is recorded in [issue-15-qa-validation.md](issue-15-qa-validation.md):
  183 passed and 1 skipped. The skip was the Tkinter UI test module in a headless environment.
- The 50-client test delivered 50 of 50 messages with a measured P90 of 0.0971 seconds in the
  recorded local run. This is a sample, not a guarantee for other hardware or networks.
- Idle expiry is implemented in the session service and periodic server worker, but no dedicated
  test currently advances a session past its timeout and verifies the expiry path.
- TLS behavior is exercised using a valid ephemeral certificate. Invalid-certificate, TLS
  downgrade, and production-certificate behavior are not comprehensively tested.
- Message writes are asynchronous. A database write error is logged and does not stop the server,
  but persistence can fail after delivery has already occurred.
- The server is single-instance; clustering and high availability are outside the current
  implementation.

The detailed requirement-by-requirement assessment, including coverage gaps, is maintained in
[requirements-traceability.md](requirements-traceability.md).
